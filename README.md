The assignment asked to modify index.js in order to complete the assinged tasks. The initial trouble faced was figuring out how to edit the options properties as well as having the personal access token not give me permission to edit or change a repository. After these conflicts were resolved, the website documention linked to the assigned tasks help format the code to get that task to work properly. The REST server set up gave me some problems. The command line did not appreciate the given sample code to post data to the server. After some research, using Windows 10 was the issue, for the command line accepted slightly different formatting in order to get the code to post the data to the server.
